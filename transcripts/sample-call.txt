Ben: Hi Sarah, thanks for taking the time today.

Sarah: Of course, happy to chat. So you mentioned you're looking at security platforms?

Ben: Yes, exactly. Can you tell me a bit about your current situation?

Sarah: Sure. We had three security breaches last year, which was a wake-up call. The board is really pushing us to fix this. We need to reduce incidents by at least 50%.

Ben: That's significant. Who else is involved in evaluating solutions?

Sarah: Well, I'm leading the technical evaluation. Mike from my team will be doing the hands-on testing. And ultimately our CFO needs to sign off on anything over 50k.

Ben: Got it. What's your timeline looking like?

Sarah: We'd like to have something in place by end of Q2. We're also looking at Competitor X, so we're trying to move relatively quickly.

Ben: Understood. Let me tell you about how our platform handles SSO since you mentioned that's important. We support SAML 2.0 and OIDC out of the box...

Sarah: That's great. Okta integration is a must for us.

Ben: Absolutely, we integrate with Okta, Azure AD, and OneLogin natively. Setup typically takes 2-3 days with your IT team.
